# **Abstract**

# **Documentation**
We used Excel to clen the data,select our variables, and create presentation quality tables for our quantitative and qualitative variables. We used R for our statistical analysis and visualizations. 

# **Data Extracting**
We used the “Database of Economic Incentives” from data.gov. It shows resources for businesses and programs seeking public and private funding. We focus on the funds the Department of State receives and allocates in different programs within New York State. We also looked at industry and occupation data from the Department of Labor within New York State.

- 'Region' refers to the geographical locations withing New York State. We categirized it to:
- 'Industry' includes multiple sectors that programs operate in. We categorized it to:
- 'Total State Awards' is the total Department of State assistance projects received.
- 'Disbursements to Date' is the amount the projects have received up to date.
