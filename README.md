# **Documentation**
We used Excel to clen the data,select our variables, and create presentation quality tables for our quantitative and qualitative variables. We used R for our statistical analysis and visualizations. 

# **Data Extracting**
We used the “Database of Economic Incentives” from data.gov. It shows resources for businesses and programs seeking public and private funding. We focus on the funds the Department of State receives and allocates in different programs within New York State. We also looked at industry and occupation data from the Department of Labor within New York State.

**Industry & Occupation Data:** https://dol.ny.gov/occupational-and-industry-data

**Original Dataset:** https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/database-of-economic-incentives 

**Cleaned Data:** (https://github.com/AGA-Datathon-2023/Data-Noobs/blob/main/NY%20Economic%20Incentives.csv)

**Description of Variables**
- The ‘Program’ variable consists of various programs that received state funding. Due to the vast amount of programs, we categorized them into: Agriculture, Business, Development, Direct Federal Funds, Employment, Environment, Federal Department of Defense, Innovation/Education, Minority/Women related Programs, Misc.,Small Business, and
Tax Programs.
- 'Region' refers to the geographical locations withing New York State. We categirized it to: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest.
- 'Industry' includes multiple sectors that programs operate in. We categorized it to: Education Arts, Food Services, Manufacturing, Professional Services, and Public Administration programs.
- 'Total State Awards' is the total Department of State assistance projects received.
- 'Disbursements to Date' is the amount the projects have received up to date.

# **Results & Interpretations**
Minority women: 
**Null rejected, so there is evidence that the average total state awards for minority women related programs is less than the threshold. 
**
In 2021, women in New York earned **88.2 cents** for every dollar earned by their male counterparts, which marked a notably smaller wage disparity compared to the national average of 81.5 cents. However, the gender pay gap remains significantly wider for women of color, both in New York and across the country. Specifically, Black or African American women in New York earned only 67.8 cents for every dollar earned by men, while Hispanic and Latina women received just 62.9 cents for each dollar earned by their male counterparts.
The economic recession triggered by the pandemic had a profound effect on the female workforce. **Between 2019 and 2021, the unemployment rate among women surged, nearly doubling from 4.2% to 8.2%. In 2021, the number of unemployed women exceeded 405,000, which marked a substantial rise compared to 2019 when it stood at 207,000.**

Occupations that are both low-paying and heavily segregated by gender, such as child care, are primarily staffed by women, who make up 90% of the workforce in this sector. Women also face a **"motherhood penalty"** because they are more likely to take temporary breaks from their careers or work part-time to care for their children.

Governor Hochul's FY 2023 Budget allocated $7 billion over four years to enhance affordable childcare access, **raising the income eligibility threshold to 300% of the federal poverty level.** This extends access to over half of New York's young children and broadens the options for childcare providers. **In 2023, Governor Hochul launched a pioneering program offering 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave to over 10,000 unrepresented state employees for bonding with a child.** The program may also extend to employees through collective bargaining with state unions.
