## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#checking OLS Assumptions 
#Right Variables: assume that we use the right variables

#Linear in the parameters: yes

#Homoscedasticity - no violation, scale - location plot partial violation
#Influential outliers - no influential outliers based on the Residuals vs. Leverage plot 
#Normally distribution errors: no violation Q-Q Residuals line is flat

#Independent errors: Residuals vs. Leverage no violation, data is withing Cook's distance lines

#check for multicollinearity - no violation vif is less than 4
